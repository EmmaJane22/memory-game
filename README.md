# Word Wise Memory Game - Emma Scott
-------------------------------------
## Introduction
Welcome to my Milestone Project 2. This simple,fun game is designed to test your memory and support the learning of animal names in German. It has been developed with my son in mind, as he is learning German at GCSE level, but is also an enjoyable game for children and adults alike.
