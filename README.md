# Word Wise Memory Game - Emma Scott
-------------------------------------
## Introduction
Welcome to my Milestone Project 2. Word Wise is a language-themed memory card game, based on the classic game of Pelmanism. This simple,fun game is designed to test your memory and support the learning of animal names in German. It has been developed with my son in mind, as he is learning German at GCSE level, but is also an enjoyable game for children and adults alike.

The game is based on a deck of 12 cards, placed face down, and the player 'flips' two cards face over each time. The object of the game is to find matching pairs of cards in the least number of moves.
